# Piscine2019

These are the pisicne exercises just as I submited them during the July piscine of 2019. 

As they are my first steps into coding, it goes without saying that most of this code is not written properly if even functional. Regardless of thequality of the code these are the first steps I took into coding and as such is worth uploading here. 

I intended to recode some, if not all of these exercises someday, in a much much better way.
