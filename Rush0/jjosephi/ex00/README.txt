-------------------------- IMPORTANT ----------------------------
GIT : Make sure you are working on the right branch (i.e not Master)

 Type : git log -> it will tell you which branch you are on.
 If you are on master and already made a branch, use : git branch to see the available branches.

 Use git checkout [branch name] to switch branch.

 If your branch doesn't exist, use : git checkout -b [branch name]
 This will both create the branch and switch to it

DO NOT MERGE. ONLY ONE PERSON SHOULD MERGE AND THAT PERSON IS ME - Johanna

-------------------------- IMPORTANT ----------------------------

WRITE YOUR INITIALS NEXT TO THE PART YOU WANT TO WORK ON
TASKS:

- Makefilejj
- Library -jj
- Norminette checkjj
- Program
	- Rush/ Sastantua check -jj
	- Shape checkjj
	- inverted Checkjj
PLAN:

- We will include all of our past rushes + sastantua and have them output a string. Our program will compare this string with the one we were provided with. 
	The shape check will look at the length , width and spaces between the start of the string and the first character;
	- We will have to check for every possible orientation ( ex: triangle could be upside down, on the side, right triangle etc...)
	- Inverted check will check if dots are on the outside or inside

--------------------------------------------------------------------

WHEN DONE, DO git push -u origin [branch name]
NEVER USE THIS COMMAND AGAIN OR I WILL MAKE YOU FIX ALL THE MERGE CONFLICTS. THANKS
